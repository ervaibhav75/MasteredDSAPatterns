'''
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

note: i solved using dutch national flag algorithm

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1

        while mid <= high:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
                low += 1
                mid += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 2:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                high -= 1
            else:
                mid += 1
